# Web App

This is the complete repository of my web app that is currently deployed to the world via AWS at https://huntermitchell.net/. 
The web app contains a home page and a project page which allows you to take a picture of yourself through webcam, 
and then uses machine learning on the backend to predict both your age and gender. Both models are pre-trained on Kaggle notebooks, 
so I am including the code for that as well.

To replicate something like this, it is highly recommended to use Docker, as that made the transition to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk much smoother.
